<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to Erin</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Twister</h3>
<p>This is my all time favorite with lots of storm scenes</p>
<h3>Dante's Peak</h3>
<p>Who does't love an erupting volcano and a love story</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>It is just the best, but it requires hours to watch all of them</p>
