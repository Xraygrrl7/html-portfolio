<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Erin and for the past 20 years I have worked in the healthcare field. I am an X-Ray Technologist by trade, but have mostly worked in Interventional Cardiology, Interventional Radiology, and Neuro Intervention for 14 years on the clinical side. The last 6 years have been spent on the industry side of healthcare in Clinical Applications and Clinical Support. </p>

<p>I have rencently moved to The Netherlands where I have decided to try and make a career change into something different. I am currently exploring the options of UX/UI Design and Web Development. Both pique my interest in different ways.</p>

<p>Currently I am enrolled and participating in Memorisely's online bootcamp for UX/UI Design and expected to complete the course at the end of May 2024. I am also taking a self-paced Web Development Bootcamp from The App Brewery, which is teaching me how to make this portfolio page. Please see the projects and their links on my page.</p>
